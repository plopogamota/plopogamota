- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @plopogamota
As a software engineering student, my GitHub profile is a showcase of my passion for coding and technology. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

As I continue my journey in software engineering, I look forward to using GitHub as a platform to connect with other developers, contribute to open source projects, and build a strong foundation for a successful career in technology.
